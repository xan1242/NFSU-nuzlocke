Welcome to the Nuzlocke Challenge!

Play through the game as fast as possible while racking up the most cash and style points!

# Rules

- Each car has a certain amount of lives.

- Losing a race event in any way is considered a loss of life, this includes: losing a race, quitting prematurely and/or restarting a race

- On the last life of a car you are not allowed to restart the race

- If you lose all lives with a car, you cannot use it anymore and MUST select a different car

- If you lose all cars = game over

- If you can't afford any car trade = game over

The challenge starts as soon as you enter Underground Mode.

# Additional notes (please read at least once)

- Keep in mind that this game addon currently does NOT save your progress and restarts every time you load or make a new profile. It is highly recommended you start from a new game every time!

- You can open the stats window anytime by pressing the PAGE DOWN key on the keyboard, here you can track all stats tracked by this addon (when it's in focus it locks the game input, be careful)

- In the difficulty selection screen, you can enable an option to replace the traffic AI with racer's AI independent of the difficulty you select.

- And lastly (if you hadn't noticed yet) you should be able to control this UI fully with a controller.

- Thanks for playing!
