Welcome to the Nuzlocke Challenge!

Play through the game as fast as possible with a limited number of lives!

# Rules

- Each car has a certain amount of lives.

- Losing a race event in any way is considered a loss of life, this includes: losing a race, quitting prematurely and/or restarting a race

- On the last life of a car you are not allowed to restart the race

- If you lose all lives with a car, you cannot use it anymore and MUST select a different car

- If you lose all cars = game over

- If you can't afford any car trade = game over

- Depending on the selected difficulty, you may not be allowed to access the car trade menu and/or select the difficulty of a race

The challenge starts as soon as you enter Underground Mode.

# Additional notes (please read at least once)

- This addon restarts every time you load or make a new profile. It is highly recommended you start from a new game every time (and play from start to finish if you can)!

- You can open the stats window anytime by pressing the PAGE DOWN key on the keyboard, here you can track all stats tracked by this addon (when it's in focus it locks the game input, be careful)

- In the difficulty selection screen, you can enable an option to replace the traffic AI with racer's AI independent of the difficulty you select.

- This addon replaces the game's mouse cursor and uses the one from the OS instead (due to technical reasons)

- The game is automatically saved any time you exit, restart or finish a race (and whenever the game does it by itself normally). Save files can be located in the 'NuzlockeSaves' directory next to the game executable. You can only have 1 saved Nuzlocke session per profile.

- And lastly (if you hadn't noticed yet) you should be able to fully control this UI with a controller.

- Thanks for playing!
